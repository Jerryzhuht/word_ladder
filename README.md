# Word Ladder

A word ladder is a connection from one word to another formed by changing one letter at a time with the constraint that at each step the sequence of letters still forms a valid word. For example, here is a word ladder connecting the word "code" to the word "data". Each changed letter is underlined as an illustration:

>cOde → cAde → caTe → Date → datA

There are many other word ladders that connect these two words, but this one is the shortest. There might be others of the same length, but none with fewer steps than this one.
